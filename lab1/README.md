# Lab 1: Requirements 

## Introduction
Before you start to provision any OCI resources, it is a good practice to create a **compartment** as an isolated environment for your work. 
In this lab, we will create a compartment for all the OCI resources required to host our PHP application

Estimated lab time: 10 minutes

## Task 1: Create Compartment

1. Log in to **OCI** and click on the <a href="#menu">&#9776; hamburger menu</a> at the top left corner of the OCI console, and type **compartment** in the search box. Click on the **Compartments** in the search result

2. Specify the name of the compartment such as **PHP-Compartment** with a description, click on **Create Compartment**

![create compartment](images/create_compartment.png)

## It works

You just created a compartment!

## Congratulations, you are ready for the next Lab!
